- 👋 Hi, I’m @James-Davies-Dr
- 👀 I’m interested in improving data analysis skills, visualisiation and generating useful information particularly with medical data, and within that my chosen specialty of obstetrics & gynaecology.  I also want to create some tools for enhancing the training of doctors in the specialty, through monitoring training needs, keeping logbooks of experience and procedures.  I have published some research using propensity score analysis to evaluate retrospective surgical cohort data and keen to enhance knowledge of other bias reduction techniques as I believe there are lots of datasets out there just waiting for someone to carve them up into actual publishable informatio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use R Shiny inculding hosting options.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with clinical research with R, propensity score matching or other techniques, buildling a logbook.
